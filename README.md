## Twitch Overlay

This is a crude implementation of a Twitch overlay to be used in OBS (with a Browser source), alongside PubNub (for websockets incoming from another script).

It is not optimised in any way, and has a hardcoded (test) PubNub subscription key.

This codebase might be refactored in the future, but for now it is intended for testing purposes only and is not considered production-ready.
